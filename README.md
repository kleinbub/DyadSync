# DyadSync

an R package for Interpersonal Physiology, and other dyadic
synchronization analyses. **IMPORTANT: the package is still in active
development and not ready for general usage. Backwards compatibility is
not granted.** If you still want to use it, I suggest you download a
local copy and install it from there, instead of using
“install_github()” or similar.

### Overview

The package contains a broad set of functions to import, filter,
analyze, and plot continuous data stemming from dyadic interactions. A
typical application is to analyze the synchronization between the
continuous physiological activity of patient and therapist across one or
more sessions. The flexible class system allows to represent most type
of designs, longitudinal or cross-sectional.

The documentation is work in progress, and is organized through
different vignettes.

####future vignettes: \* class system \* Comparison between different
signals \* Synchrony within specific epochs, or time markers
